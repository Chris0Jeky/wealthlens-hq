"""Resolve and verify chunk-level citations (ADR 0001 §4).

A cited chunk_id is only served if it resolves to a real chunk in the corpus
AND that chunk was part of the evidence the model was actually shown.
Resolution attaches the ingestion-time provenance (source_id, document_id,
section, page) and the source's citable name + URL from the registry
(registries/sources.yml). Anything that does not resolve is stripped and
flagged: a fabricated citation is worse than no answer, so this module never
lets one reach the user.

Three unresolvable cases, all stripped and reported (loudly logged, and
returned in ``ResolvedCitations.unresolved_chunk_ids``):

- **fabricated** — the id was not in the supplied evidence. compose.py already
  marks these in ``ComposedAnswer.fabricated_chunk_ids``; provenance the model
  never saw cannot vouch for a claim, even in the rare case that the id happens
  to name a real chunk, so it is dropped without a lookup.
- **missing** — the id has no row in the ``chunks`` table. For an
  evidence-grounded id this is a data anomaly (e.g. the chunk was re-ingested
  away mid-request); for anything else it is a plain fabrication.
- **unknown-source** — the chunk exists but its ``source_id`` is absent from the
  registry, so no citable source name/URL can be produced. That is a
  provenance/registry integrity fault (ingestion admitted a chunk whose source
  is not catalogued), and a citation with no source is not a citation.

Citation resolvability is one of the deterministic eval checks (H1-20/H1-23),
so the resolution logic is pure and DB-free-testable: the database fetch and
the registry load are thin wrappers around ``_resolve_citations``, which the
done-when fixture exercises without a database (CI has no Postgres).
