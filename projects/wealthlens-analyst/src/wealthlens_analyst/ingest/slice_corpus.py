"""Ingest the frozen corpus slice into the chunks table.

Two ingestion paths, one provenance contract (ADR 0001 §4):

1. Tabular sources (ONS WAS, HMRC) — rendered to citable text from the
   EXISTING pipelines' processed outputs (automation/data-pipelines/ writes
   projects/wealthlens-dashboard/data/processed/*.csv). One chunk per table
   section/band, carrying period and units, so a citation can say exactly which
   statistic backed a claim. Implemented here (task H1-07).
2. Report documents (IFS/RF PDFs from fetch_documents.py) — page-aware
   extraction, ~500-token heading-anchored chunks with page + span recorded.
   Pending task H1-08.

Every chunk row carries source_id (registries/sources.yml id), document_id,
section, page, span. The per-type rule (tabular: section + span, no page;
document: page + span) is enforced at write time (task H1-09); the renderers
here always emit conformant chunks.

Data-honesty guardrails baked into the tabular renderer:
- A missing/suppressed cell is OMITTED, never rendered as a fabricated 0. A
  genuine zero in the source still renders as "0", and a sub-microunit non-zero
  keeps its value rather than collapsing to "0".
- The honesty filter is an ALLOWLIST (fail-closed): a row is ingested only when
  its data_source marker is a known-official value (e.g. "live"). Anything else
  — an illustrative fallback, an unrecognised marker, a blank, or a missing
  column — is SKIPPED, so the analyst never cites fabricated or unverified
  figures as official facts. (This mirrors the spend cap's fail-closed posture.)

Size-threshold tables (HMRC CGT) get two extra, source-faithful renderings so a
citation can state concentration directly (seeded follow-up from the H1-07
review; serves golden G-007/G-008):
- each band's label becomes an explicit RANGE — its lower bound "to under" the
  next band's lower bound (the bands are half-open), the top band reading "and
  above" — so HMRC's "£X+" band name is never misread as an "above £X"
  cumulative threshold; and
- a CUMULATIVE concentration clause from the cumul_*_from_top columns, e.g.
  "taxpayers with gains of £X and above accounted for Y% of all taxable gains
  and made up Z% of all CGT taxpayers" — each share carries its own verb so a
  money share and a headcount share are never grammatically conflated. Shares
  are clamped to <=100% to absorb the rounding artefact of summing
  already-rounded per-band shares (a value beyond tolerance is OMITTED, not
  shown wrong — the same fail-closed posture).
The span still pins the raw HMRC band label, so provenance stays faithful while
the rendered text is unambiguous.

Entrypoint: `make ingest-slice` (fetch -> chunk -> write -> FTS -> embed),
wired in task H1-09.
