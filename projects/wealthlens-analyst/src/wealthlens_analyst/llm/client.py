"""The thin LLM client seam — the ONLY module that touches provider SDKs.

ADR 0002: one Protocol, concrete implementations behind it, token/cost
accounting included in every result so the budget middleware and the public
metrics page never depend on a provider's shape.

Provider SDK imports happen INSIDE methods (lazy), so importing this module —
and everything above it — never requires the provider package or credentials.

Provider: OpenAI for BOTH embeddings (ADR 0003 D2: text-embedding-3-small, 1536
dims) and generation (gpt-5.4-mini — Chris's provider call 2026-06-30, superseding
the claude-sonnet-4-6 default; not an ADR D-decision). Model ids come from
configuration (EMBEDDING_MODEL / ANALYST_MODEL), never hard-coded. Embeddings
(`embed`) land here in H1-11; generation (`complete`) in H1-18.
