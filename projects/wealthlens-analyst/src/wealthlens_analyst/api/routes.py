- POST /ask           — the analyst. Body: {"question": ...}.
                        * Plain mode (H1-20): hybrid retrieval -> cited
                          composition -> citation resolution, returning the
                          published response schema (api/schemas.py): an
                          ``answer`` with resolved citations, or a ``refusal``
                          when the corpus does not support a cited answer. The
                          full confidence gate (weak-but-nonempty evidence) is
                          H1-21/H1-22; H1-20 refuses only the degenerate cases
                          (no evidence at all, or no citation that resolves).
                          The budget guard (H1-27) adds the ``over_budget`` (429)
                          variant. Every request writes a query_log row.
                        * ?debug=retrieval (H1-13) returns the RRF-fused
                          candidate list with per-chunk provenance and both
                          component ranks, WITHOUT generation — a diagnostic
                          surface, not a product answer.
- GET  /healthz       — liveness: app up, DB reachable.
- GET  /metrics/data  — JSON for the public metrics page: p50/p95 latency and
                        cost per query, computed from query_log (ADR 0002).
                        Cache hit rate is added only when caching lands.

Accounting (ADR 0002): every /ask request writes one query_log row carrying the
REAL per-request spend summed across every model call it made (the query
embedding, plus generation in plain mode). A served/refused outcome whose row
cannot be written fails the request (500) rather than serve unmetered spend;
failure paths write an `error` row best-effort without masking the original
error. tokens_out and generation cost are 0 in debug mode (no generation).
