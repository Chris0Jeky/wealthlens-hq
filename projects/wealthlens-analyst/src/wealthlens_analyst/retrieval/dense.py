"""Dense retrieval over pgvector.

Embeds the query through the LLM client seam (llm/client.py — the ONLY module
allowed to touch provider SDKs, ADR 0002) and runs cosine-similarity search
against the `embeddings` table (HNSW index; see
migrations/versions/0002_embeddings.py).

Embedding model: ADR 0003 D2 = OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (1536 dims,
matching migration 0002). This module reads it from configuration via the seam
and must not hard-code a provider.
