Mostly pure-Python (no DB, no model calls). The renderer takes already-read
rows; one IO test exercises collect_tabular_chunks against a temp fixture CSV

suppressed cells never fabricated as 0, genuine zeros preserved, the fail-closed
official-only allowlist, span disambiguation, number formatting, and the
