"""Lock the FTS query's provenance mapping + guards (H1-10, ADR 0001).

DB-free by design (CI has no Postgres): these cover the pure row->ChunkHit
mapping, 1-based ranking, type coercion, and the limit guards. The SQL itself —
websearch_to_tsquery over the GIN-indexed tsvector, ts_rank ordering, and that
the index is used — is verified live against the analyst-db container (recorded
in the PR), not here.
