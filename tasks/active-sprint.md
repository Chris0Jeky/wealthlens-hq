# Active Sprint

Last updated: 2026-06-04

> **LATEST (2026-06-04):** Full PR drain. Merged to main: **#339** (IHT RNRB
> taper regression reverted, HMRC-verified), **#340–#344** (5 Dependabot), and
> **#338** (uncertainty *sampling* layer, hardened over 7 codex rounds + 4
> adversarial reviews). Open stack → main: **#345** uncertainty *propagation*
> (reviewed, all findings fixed; merge-ready) and **#346** engine Monte-Carlo
> *wiring* (default OFF; under 2-lens review). 751 sim tests; CI green.
> Caveat: `make ci-quick` still hides dashboard backend pytest failures (exits 0);
> tracked in `tasks/inbox.md`, gated on Chris (ACTION-REQUIRED #6).

This week's focus. Keep this list to 5-7 tasks.

## Sprint: 2026-05-30 to 2026-06-06 (Wave 13 — calibrate, surface, extend)

**Status:** Full Wave 12 engine is on `main` through **#335**, and Wave 13 #336
`feat/enforcement-compliance-model` is merged. **#337**
`feat/synth-generation-provenance` is open as the newest Wave 13 PR. Do not merge
#337 while it is newest; run the full two-review gate, fix every finding/comment,
and open another PR above it first.

1. - [x] **Drain PR #333** (`outputs.to_dashboard_json` + golden files + the
   provenance-label/caveat bot fixes) → main (@Chris) [completed: 2026-05-30]
2. - [x] **Calibrate the synth generator to CITED public WAS/ONS marginals** — PR
   #335 merged after two adversarial reviews, bot-thread cleanup, green CI, and
   a newer PR above it. (@Chris) [completed: 2026-05-30]
3. - [x] **Drain PR #334** (headline-revenue example) after a new PR lands above it (@Chris) [completed: 2026-05-30]
4. - [x] **Review/drain #336 proper enforcement compliance model** — merged to
   main after two independent adversarial review rounds; fixed enforcement cost
   vs revenue, NAO year/source, interval invariants, and enforcement provenance.
   (@Chris) [completed: 2026-05-30]
5. - [x] Wave 13: review/drain #337 synth generation provenance — merged to main
   at `94446e3` after two independent adversarial reviews, all bot threads
   resolved, green CI, and a newer PR (#338) opened above it. (@Chris) [completed: 2026-05-31]
6. - [x] Wave 13: drain #338 `feat/uncertainty-sampling` — **merged** to main
   (`3b31de2`) after 7 codex P2 rounds + 4 adversarial reviews. (@Chris) [completed: 2026-06-04]
7. - [~] Wave 13: build the uncertainty **propagation** layer (#345) + wire it into
   the engine as an optional Monte-Carlo revenue band, default OFF (#346, stacked
   on #345). #345 merge-ready; #346 under review. Then: more sampled parameters
   (assumption RangeValues), Sobol sensitivity, and a Vue ConfidenceFanChart that
   renders the dashboard JSON band + caveats. See `tasks/inbox.md`. (@Chris)

## Completed sprint: 2026-05-29 to 2026-06-05 (Wave 12 engine)

**Context:** The entire Gate-1 simulator (skeleton, schema, loaders, top-tail
reconstruction, provenance, all 7 policy families A–G) is MERGED to `main` (PRs
#284–#326). Wave 12 (the engine driving them) is underway: `synth/` (#327) and
`rules/run_scenario` (#328) merged. 564 sim tests pass; ci-sim green; 0 open PRs.

1. - [x] CI gap: add `packages/wealthlens-sim` to CI — ci-sim.yml + types-PyYAML + scipy mypy override (PR #323) (@Chris) [completed: 2026-05-29]
2. - [x] IHT v0.1: deduct charitable bequest from estate; cap RNRB at residence value (PR #324) (@Chris) [completed: 2026-05-29]
3. - [x] Security: patch tmp/uuid Dependabot alerts via npm overrides (PR #325) (@Chris) [completed: 2026-05-29]
4. - [x] Package registries into wheel+sdist via hatch build hook + resolver fallback (PR #326) (@Chris) [completed: 2026-05-29]
5. - [x] Wave 12 PR1 `synth/`: deterministic synthetic-population generator (PR #327) (@Chris) [completed: 2026-05-29]
6. - [x] Wave 12 PR2 `rules/`: Scenario + run_scenario over the population (PR #328) (@Chris) [completed: 2026-05-29]
7. - [x] **Wave 12 PR3 `engine/`** (built as a 5-PR stack): `engine.simulate(population, scenario, *, registries, devolution, enforcement) -> EngineResult` — synth→rules→provenance, real interval propagation, equal-weight per-decile attribution, F/G composition, `outputs.to_dashboard_json` + golden + a runnable example (@Chris) [engine merged: 2026-05-30; #333/#334/#335 merged]
   - 3a `feat/engine-core` **#329 merged** · 3b devolution **#330 merged** · 3c enforcement **#331 merged** · 3d intervals **#332 merged** · 3e outputs **#333 merged** · Wave-13 example **#334 merged**. Each: 2 adversarial reviews + all bot comments addressed.

## Why These

- **Merge cycle (1–4):** cleared all 38 open PRs with rigour; closed the CI gap (simulator was untested in CI), the IHT data-integrity simplifications, the security alerts, and the pip-install packaging gap — each its own reviewed PR.
- **Wave 12 (5–7):** the policy families existed but nothing drove them. `synth/` supplies a population, `rules/` runs a scenario over it; the **engine PR (7)** ties synth→rules→provenance into a single `EngineResult` — the first end-to-end headline-revenue number. Then `outputs/` formats it for the dashboard.
- **Follow-ups (backlog, not this sprint):** review/drain #337 synth generation provenance; Monte-Carlo uncertainty (Wave 13); real WAS/FRS microdata behind the Protocol seam.
